First, rinse the rice 2-3 times until water runs clear—this removes excess starch ensuring separate grains. Soak for 20-30 minutes to allow grains to absorb water evenly, resulting in perfect elongation. Use a 1:2 rice-to-water ratio for fluffy texture. Add a few drops of lemon juice or ghee to enhance aroma and prevent sticking. Bring water to a rolling boil, add rice, then reduce heat to low and cover tightly. Cook for 15-18 minutes without lifting the lid. Let it rest for 5 minutes before fluffing with a fork. For biryani, parboil rice to 70% doneness before layering with curry. The dum cooking technique infuses flavors beautifully. For pulao, saut\xe9 rice in ghee before adding water to enhance nutty flavor. Store Veer Bharat rice in airtight containers away from moisture.
